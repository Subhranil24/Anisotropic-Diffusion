# Anisotropic-Diffusion
This is the MATLAB code for the Anisotropic Diffusion.

The function takes four parameters. Parameter that the function takes are in the following order-
AnisotropicDiffusion(image,kappa,lambda,no_itr)
where image should be an image,
kappa is the kappa value,
lambda is the lambda parameter that weighs the updated value at each iteration,
typical lambda value should be between 0 & 0.25,
and no_itr is the number of iterations (generally chosen between 2 to 10).
